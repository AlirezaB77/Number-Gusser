This is a simple number guessing game implemented in Python. The game generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player tries to guess it.

## Features

- Score tracking (starting at 100, decreasing by 10 for each incorrect guess)
- Option to play multiple rounds

## How to Play

1. Run the script.
2. Enter a number between 1 and 100 when prompted.
3. Receive feedback on your guess.
4. Keep guessing until you find the correct number.
5. Choose to play again or quit after each successful round.

## Code Structure
